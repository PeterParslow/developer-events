# Metadata Codesprint Engineering Report
## Introduction
The OGC GeoDCAT SWG (with the OGC MetaCata DWG) ran a two day code sprint, as described at https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoDCAT-SWG/tree/main/workshops/2024/OGC_Metadata_Codesprint
A lot of possible work items had been proposed as issues (https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoDCAT-SWG/issues) in that repository & as comments on one specific issue (https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoDCAT-SWG/issues/17). With two developers in the room, two in the Americas and the promise of some joining from Europe, it emerged that the favourite topic areas were:
* alignment with PROV - GeoDCAT & PROV or OGC API Records & PROV 
* metadata for AI / OGC API Processes & Large Language Models
* ISO 19115-1 to (Geo)DCAT mapping 

Others present start drafting this engineering report.
