# Metadata Codesprint Engineering Report
The OGC GeoDCAT SWG (with the OGC MetaCata DWG) ran a two day code sprint, as described at https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoDCAT-SWG/tree/main/workshops/2024/OGC_Metadata_Codesprint
A lot of possible work items had been proposed as issues (https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoDCAT-SWG/issues) in that repository & as comments on one specific issue (https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoDCAT-SWG/issues/17). With two developers in the room, two in the Americas and the promise of some joining from Europe, it seemed that the favourite topic areas were:
* alignment with PROV - GeoDCAT & PROV or OGC API Records & PROV (#24) e.g. as part of a OGC API Records GeoDCAT response (https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoDCAT-SWG/issues/17#issuecomment-2434553700, https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoDCAT-SWG/issues/17#issuecomment-2444035107, https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoDCAT-SWG/issues/17#issuecomment-2477705703)
* metadata for AI / OGC API Processes & Large Language Models (#18)(
* ISO 19115-1 to (Geo)DCAT mapping (https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoDCAT-SWG/issues/17#issuecomment-2477907159 could inform https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoDCAT-SWG/issues/17#issuecomment-2376563378)
