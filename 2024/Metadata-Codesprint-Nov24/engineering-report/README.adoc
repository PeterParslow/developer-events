= Standard template in Metanorma

== Content

This repository contains the content for an OGC standard.

* `document.adoc` - the main standard document with references to all sections
* remaining ``adoc``s - each section of the standard document is in a separate document: follow directions in each document to populate
* `figures` - figures go here
* `images` - Image files for graphics go here. Image files for figures go in the `figures` directory. Only place in here images not used in figures (e.g., as parts of tables, as logos, etc.)
* `requirements` - directory for requirements and requirement classes to be referenced in `clause_7_normative_text.adoc`
* `code` - sample code to accompany the standard, if desired
* `abstract_tests` - the Abstract Test Suite comprising one test for every requirement, optional
* `UML` - UML diagrams, if applicable

== Building using docker

Navigate into the folder containing the file `document.adoc`, and then run the following command.

```
docker run -v "$(pwd)":/metanorma -v ${HOME}/.fontist/fonts/:/config/fonts  metanorma/metanorma  metanorma compile --agree-to-terms -t ogc -x xml,html document.adoc
```

If the build is successful, an HTML file will be generated with the name `document.html`.
