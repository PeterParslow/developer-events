== Conclusions

The code sprint provided a significant opportunity to highlight the heterogeneous nature of metadata standards and perspectives from multiple stakeholders.  As a result it was possible to articulate a coherent framework for understanding scope of different activities and a propose a coherent architecture to guide ongoing work in metadata standards.

In addition, progress was made on a number of specific activities, providing a validation that the proposed framework can be progressed incrementally, without it being necessary for all participants to fully engage with all the diverse aspects of metadata standardisation. The general principles of improving FAIR-ness of metadata standards, whilst supporting multiple existing and emerging communities

=== Future Work

==== Experimentation

The sprint participants made the following recommendations regarding potential experiments in future Collaborative Solutions and Innovation (COSI) Program initiatives:

* Focus on FAIR publication of mappings between metadata standards
*
* Support for XSLT2 transformations

==== Prototyping

The sprint participants made the following recommendations regarding prototype development in future COSI initiatives:

*

==== Standardization

The sprint participants made the following recommendations regarding future discussions in working groups and the Standards Program:

* Discussion on consistency of parameter and schema fragments in APIs
* Development of a roadmap for a possible TrainingDML-AI conformance class for OGC API - Records
* Guidance on the consistency of scale between Observations, Measurements, and Samples (OMS) and the API Standards
* Addition of a security element in future versions of TrainingDML-AI and other metadata encodings
* Run a code sprint focused on machine-readable provenance chains, model reproducibility, and recording data quality.
* Update OGC RAINBOW to offer executable code and variable injection to ensure the chains are machine readable.
* Test the process of machine-readable provenance chains with several different datasets with a focus on model reproducibility.
* Provide feedback to ISO/TC 211 on findings regarding Data Quality and AI.
