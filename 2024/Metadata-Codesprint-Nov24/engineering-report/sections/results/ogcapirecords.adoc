==== OGC API - Records

Experimentation related to OGC API - Records included extension of pygeoapi to enable support for including Provenance details in Records. (Note the previous codesprint has explored capture of provenance in OGC API Processes. A detailed summary is presented in <<results_pygeoapi>>.

The provenance model used is based on the W3C provenance model and a [draft "Building Block" that defines a JSON schema and a mapping directly to PROV using JSON-LD](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblock-prov-schema/bblock/ogc.ogc-utils.prov).

In addition participants explored the mapping of OGC API Records to DCAT and GeoDCAT.

TBD- feedback from Conterra
